5. **Implement a problem of activity selection problem with K persons.**  
   **Statement:** Given two arrays S[] and E[] of size N denoting starting and closing time of the shops and an integer value K denoting the number of people, the task is to find out the maximum number of shops they can visit in total if they visit each shop optimally based on the following conditions:  
    A shop can be visited by only one person.  
    A person cannot visit another shop if its timing collides with it.

6. **Implement a problem of maximizing Profit by trading stocks based on given rate per day.**  
   **Statement:** Given an array arr[] of N positive integers which denotes the cost of selling and buying stock on each of the N days. The task is to find the maximum profit that can be earned by buying a stock on or selling all previously bought stocks on a particular day.  
   **2 CO1**

7. **Implement a problem of minimum work to be done per day to finish given tasks within D days problem.**  
   **Statement:** Given an array task [] of size N denoting amount of work to be done for each task, the problem is to find the minimum amount of work to be done on each day so that all the tasks can be completed in at most D days.  
   **Note:** On one day work can be done for only one task.

### CO3

13. **Implement Check if it is possible to transform one string to another.**  
    **Statement:** - Given two strings s1 and s2 (all letters in uppercase). Check if it is possible to convert s1 to s2 by performing following operations.  
    1. Make some lowercase letters upper.  
    2. Delete all the lowercase letters  
    **2 CO3**

14. **CIA 3 - Capstone Project: Develop and implement a solution for the given problem using dynamic programming approach.**  
    The project should be coded on a chosen programming platform and all code must be updated and maintained in a GitHub repository for version control and collaboration.
